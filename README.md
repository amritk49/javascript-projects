This repo contain the projects that i am making using javascript

1. Magic Notes - a simple notes taking application made using local storage and editable div. Use it as per requirement.  
2. Dynamic Typing Speed Test - Test your typing speed. Kudos to you if you can type more than 50 words in 1 minute. 
3. Image Rating Webpage - Give stars to randomly generated image. Images are randomly generated using picsum photos. 
4. Word Scramble Game - Can you guess all the beautiful programming languages out there ? Play the game and Try it out.
5. One Piece Music Player - Made for myself as i love watching animes and listening to OST while i am coding. You can modify the music and image according to your own needs. The music player also has a progress bar and you can fast forward the song by clikcing anywhere on the progres bar. I have also added a rotating transition which rotates while the song plays and it will stop when the song is paused. The next song will automitacally play once the current song ends or you can click on the next button to play the next song.
