3. Image Rating Webpage - Give stars to randomly generated image. Images are randomly generated using picsum photos. 

4. Word Scramble Game - Can you guess all the beautiful programming languages out there ? Play the game and Try it out.

5. One Piece Music Player - Made for myself as i love watching animes and listening to OST while i am coding. You can modify the music and image according to your own needs. The music player also has a progress bar and you can fast forward the song by clikcing anywhere on the progres bar. I have also added a rotating transition which rotates while the song plays and it will stop when the song is paused. The next song will automitacally play once the current song ends or you can click on the next button to play the next song. 

6. Dynamic Quotes Genearator and instant Tweet it using 1 click - Every morning, i like to start my day by reading a fresh motivating quote from any wise men and share it on my twitter feed. This service lets me do it using 1 clikc by using external API and by using Twitter intent service. Same can be made for instagram and watsapp status.
